        <h4>How do they work?</h4>
          <p>On the hard drive platter, there is a thin coating of magnetic grains. The alignment of the grains represents a binary "0" or "1".
            As the platter spins and the grains pass under the read/write head, the small magnet in the head can check or change the alignment of the grains.
            Different types of magnets in the read/write head and various chemical compounds on the platter can affect the speed and amount of data stored.
            Multiple read/write heads and platters can be stacked to have even more storage.

        <h4>How do they work?</h4>
          <p>Solid state drives contain flash memory modules. These are different from the ones used in RAM, as these can store data without constant power. 
            When writing new data to the drive, the controller decides where the information is to go. 
            This decision is based on which blocks are filled or worn out.
            The cache can be used to store small pieces of data as they are moved in and out of the drive, or between different places on the drive. 
          </p>
          <p>Flash modules are made up of silicon transistors. 
            The transistors have 4 main parts: source, drain, control gate, and floating gate.
            When a positive current is supplied to both the control gate and drain, electrons (negatively charged particles) go from source to drain. 
            Some of these electrons will stick to the floating gate, therefore representing a binary "0". 
            When a negative current is applied to the drain and a positive to the control gate, electrons are cleared from the floating gate, representing a "1". 
            To check the state of the transistor, a current is applied to the control gate and the resulting voltage is measured. 
          </p>
          <p>Because there are no moving parts, this allows flash memory to be faster than hard disk drives. 
            However, there is a downside.
            Each time a block is reset, its electrical resistance increases and more power is required to use it. 
            Eventually, it reaches the point where the drive cannot supply enough power.
          </p>

        <h4>How do they work?</h4>
          <p>Optical discs are usually made up of polycarbonate coated with a thin layer of aluminum.
            Discs that can only be written to once, the aluminum is coated in an organic dye, while "re-recordable" disc are coated in an alloy of silver, indium, antimony and tellurium. 
            On the aluminum, data is stored as "pits" (binary 0) and "lands" (binary 1). 
            Data is read from the disc by directing a laser at the lines of pits and lands, then looking at the reflection. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A popular type of disc for storing high-definition movies is BluRay. 
            BluRay's high storage capacity is achieved by using blue light, which has a shorter wavelength than the traditional red laser. 
            The shorter wavelength allows more pits and lands to be packed onto the disc.
