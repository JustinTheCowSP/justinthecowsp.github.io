			- The top manufacturers for hard disk drives are Western Digital and Seagate <br>
			- Hard disks are usually made up of platters, read/write head which are both contained in a case <br> <br>
			
			<h4>
				
				How do hard drives find, collect and store data?
				
			</h4>
			
			&emsp; - Hard drives operate by magnetizing ferrous grains on film on a metal platter<br>
			&emsp; Metal platter spins
			&emsp; Head checks/changes rotation of metal grains with magnet as it passes
			&emsp; Allows head to access all parts of platter
			&emsp; Rotation of metal magnetic field of grains represents 1’s and 0’s
			&emsp; Can be&emsp;  multiple platters for more storage
