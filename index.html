- The top manufacturers for hard disk drives are Western Digital and Seagate <br>
- Hard disks are usually made up of platters, read/write head which are both contained in a case <br>
- Hard drives operate by magnetizing ferrous grains on film on a metal platter<br>
Metal platter spins
Head checks/changes rotation of metal grains with magnet as it passes
Allows head to access all parts of platter
Rotation of metal magnetic field of grains represents 1’s and 0’s
Can be multiple platters for more storage
